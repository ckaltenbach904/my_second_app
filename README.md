# README
This is my second app using Bootstrap and Ruby on Rails. I deploy this APP on heroku and you can check it out: https://my-second-app123.herokuapp.com/

It has contact form to fill out and I can received your email. You can also edit the recent post (as a User) and make changes on the list of artist. At the bottom of the page there is also a google map.

Please take note that this is only a sample app to show to customer that they can have a webpage where they can login as admin/user and to show to their customer an info regarding their shop.
